# autoencoders
The power of autoencoders: This method uses the Keras library to apply autoencoders on the MNIST dataset to get rid of the noise from each picture. we use visualization to show how the dimension reduction worked in our dataset.
Finally, in addition to the autoencoders, we tried modifying the method by removing LeakyReLU from the encoder part. Consequently, the results show how much this activation function is important for encoding.
